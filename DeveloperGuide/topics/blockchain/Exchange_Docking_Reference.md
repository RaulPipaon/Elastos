# Exchange Docking Reference
## Data synchronization and storage
Use the node’s RPC interface synchronize blocks and transactions, then save all the received blocks and transactions.
This process requires dealing with temporary fork blocks. If the blocks acquired by the height can't be connected with the local stored best chain, the highest local block should be regained until they're connected. The original block with the same height will be discarded.

## Recharge
To prevent the issue of temporary forking, it is recommended that more than 16 confirmations be considered as available transactions.

## Coin withdraw
The exchange maintains the UTXO set of every address to generate the currency transaction. The withdrawal transaction can be generated by the transaction utility.
